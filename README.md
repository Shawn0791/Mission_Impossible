## Game Overview
An incredible VR experience.

A VR experience based on The Borrowers, in which the player takes on the role of a very small villain exploring a huge room and trying to "borrow" some honey. The player needs to avoid various dangerous areas in the room, such as gaps between tables and the pendulum of the clock swinging. The player also has to watch out for creatures that are very large in relation to the player, such as a mouse hiding in a gap in the window sill and a cat on the edge of a pile of toys on the floor.

Avoid waking up the owner of the room and "borrow" as many supplies as possible!

## Design Concept

Based on the story "The Borrowers," this VR game project allows players to take on the role of a tiny person exploring a massive room and attempting to "borrow" essential items for survival.

## Game Mechanics

Given the player's diminutive size, even small crevices can become passable routes. However, some tiny creatures pose significant threats to the player.

## Game Highlights

Navigate through the enormous room by picking up and using items, overcoming challenges with clever solutions, and moving around through climbing and jumping.
